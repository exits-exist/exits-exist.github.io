                    Hello World! You've found the internet home of soon to be music sensation, Exits Exist; A genre defying experience in sound! (Okay really, we're like jazzy pop-rock, or something, I don't know, you decide). We are a trio of percussionists pretending we know how to play other instruments named, in no particular order, Ethan Foster (drums, guitar, ukulele, keys, backing-vocals, percussion, kazoo, melodica, cymbal screeches) Sean Ezenwugo (piano, keys, backing-vocals, keyboards, falsetto, more keys percussion, vibraslap) and Ethan Velez (bass guitar, drums, keys, mandolin, backing-backing-vocals, cajon, bongos, beatbox).

                    Currently, we are in the midst of producing our debut LP, Vicarious Existence, in our "mobile home studio". If you would like to get a taste of our sound, demo traccks from our LP can be found on our <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>. Free downloads will be made available soon as soon as I figure out how to set that up.
                </p>
